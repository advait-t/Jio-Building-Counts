# Jio Building Counts
Project made to identify and count objects in a polygon without using high CPU/GPU usage techniques and algorithms and Deep Learning methods.

## Objectives
1. To identify potential methods to create an object detection model without the usage of GPU or have high compute requirements.
2. To identify an accurate, up-to-date and easy-to-use map provider like Google Maps, Map My India and others.
3. Use the current dataset with the given polygon coordinates to use as input for the object detection model.
4. Easily add the predicted values to the main dataset.
5. Easy integration with the current optimization pipeline.

## Installation
TODO: Run the IPYNB for Jupyter/Colab execution.
Run the rest for terminal execution.

## Usage
<pre>
To run code "python running_code.py {path-to-cluster-file} {path-to-final-output-file}"
</pre>
